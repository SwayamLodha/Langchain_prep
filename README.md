# 🚀 LangChain Prep Repository

This repository contains my hands-on practice, experiments, and notes while learning and implementing **LangChain** for building AI-powered applications.  
It includes multiple examples on LLMs, embeddings, structured outputs, document loaders, chains, chatbots, and more.
